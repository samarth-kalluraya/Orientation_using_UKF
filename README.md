#Orientation tracking using Unscented Kalman Filter
Using IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope reading) an Unscented Kalman Filter was implemented to track the orientation in 3 dimensional space.The model parameters were deteremined using ground truth data provided by Vicon motion capture system.

###Results
The plots for the estimated orientation along with the ground truth data (Vicon) are
